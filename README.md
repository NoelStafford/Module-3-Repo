Password Creation

Description:
    If you were to visit this website you would be prompted with a button to help you generate a random password. This project was helpful in starting my understanding of javascript and how it can be used dynamically.
    While building this project we learned how to make arrays. I aslo learned how to create a loop and have it check for validation of what the user is inputting. I learned how to combine multiple strings. 

Acceptance Criteria:
    GIVEN I need a new, secure password
    WHEN I click the button to generate a password
    THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
    WHEN prompted for password criteria
    THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
    WHEN prompted for the length of the password
    THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
    WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
    THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
    WHEN I answer each prompt
    THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
    WHEN all prompts are answered
    THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
    WHEN the password is generated
    THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

User story:
    AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
    I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
    SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
